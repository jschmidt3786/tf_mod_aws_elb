# ELB Module
Provides an Elastic Load Balancer resource.

https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/elb.html

## Input Variables, required
| Variable | Description | Default Value |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| availability_zones | (Required for an EC2-classic ELB) The AZ's to serve traffic in. | - |
| subnets | (Required for a VPC ELB) A list of subnet IDs to attach to the ELB. | - |
| listener | (Required) A list of listener blocks. | - |

## Input Variables, optional
| Variable | Description | Default Value |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| name | (Optional) The name of the ELB. By default generated by Terraform. | - |
| name_prefix | (Optional, Forces new resource) Creates a unique name beginning with the specified prefix. Conflicts with name. | (unavailable in older TF versions) |
| access_logs | (Optional) An Access Logs block. Access Logs documented below. | - |
| security_groups | (Optional) A list of security group IDs to assign to the ELB. | - |
| instances | (Optional) A list of instance ids to place in the ELB pool. | - |
| internal | (Optional) If true, ELB will be an internal ELB. | - |
| health_check | (Optional) A health_check block. | - |
| cross_zone_load_balancing | (Optional) Enable cross-zone load balancing. | true |
| idle_timeout | (Optional) The time in seconds that the connection is allowed to be idle. | 60 |
| connection_draining | (Optional) Boolean to enable connection draining. | false |
| connection_draining_timeout | (Optional) The time in seconds to allow for connections to drain. | 300 |
| tags | (Optional) A mapping of tags to assign to the resource. | - |

Exactly one of availability_zones or subnets must be specified: this determines if the ELB exists in a VPC or in EC2-classic.

## Output Variables
| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| id | The name of the ELB |
| name | The name of the ELB |
| dns_name | The DNS name of the ELB |
| instances | The list of instances in the ELB |
| source_security_group | The name of the security group that you can use as part of your inbound rules for your load balancer's back-end application instances. Use this for Classic or Default VPC only. |
| source_security_group_id | The ID of the security group that you can use as part of your inbound rules for your load balancer's back-end application instances. Only available on ELBs launched in a VPC. |
| zone_id | The canonical hosted zone ID of the ELB (to be used in a Route 53 Alias record) |
